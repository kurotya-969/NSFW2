# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing sentiment analysis system in the Mari AI Chat application to focus on emotional context and expression strength rather than just specific keywords. The goal is to create a more nuanced and context-aware affection system that responds to the overall emotional tone and intensity of user messages, making Mari's relationship progression feel more natural and responsive to conversational context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want Mari's affection system to respond to the emotional context of my messages rather than just specific keywords, so that our interactions feel more natural and nuanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL analyze the overall emotional context rather than just checking for specific keywords
2. WHEN the user expresses emotions with varying intensity THEN the system SHALL detect the strength of the emotional expression and adjust affection changes accordingly
3. WHEN the user sends a message with mixed emotions THEN the system SHALL identify the dominant emotional tone and respond appropriately
4. WHEN the user's message contains sarcasm or irony THEN the system SHALL attempt to detect these nuances and avoid misinterpreting them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want Mari to respond differently to the same keywords used in different contexts, so that our conversations feel more authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uses positive words in a negative context THEN the system SHALL recognize the overall negative sentiment
2. WHEN the user uses negative words in a positive context THEN the system SHALL recognize the overall positive sentiment
3. WHEN the user's message contains emotional qualifiers (very, extremely, slightly) THEN the system SHALL adjust the sentiment intensity accordingly
4. WHEN the user's message contains contextual cues that modify sentiment THEN the system SHALL incorporate these cues into the analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want Mari's affection system to consider conversation history when analyzing sentiment, so that the relationship progression feels more coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a user message THEN the system SHALL consider recent conversation history for context
2. WHEN the user's sentiment shifts dramatically THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate smoothing to avoid unrealistic affection jumps
3. WHEN the user maintains consistent sentiment over multiple messages THEN the system SHALL gradually strengthen the affection impact
4. WHEN the user shows a pattern of behavior THEN the system SHALL recognize this pattern and adjust affection changes accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want Mari's affection system to be more resilient to misinterpretation and false positives, so that our relationship progression feels fair and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is uncertain about sentiment analysis THEN it SHALL apply more conservative affection changes
2. WHEN the user's message is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL weigh multiple possible interpretations
3. WHEN the system detects potential misinterpretation THEN it SHALL apply appropriate confidence scoring
4. WHEN the system has low confidence in its analysis THEN it SHALL minimize affection impact until more clear signals are received

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced sentiment analysis system to integrate seamlessly with the existing affection system, so that implementation is efficient and backward compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new sentiment analysis THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing affection tracking system
2. WHEN analyzing sentiment THEN the system SHALL produce output in the same format expected by the affection tracker
3. WHEN deploying the enhanced system THEN existing user sessions and affection levels SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN the system encounters errors in advanced sentiment analysis THEN it SHALL gracefully fall back to the simpler keyword-based approach
