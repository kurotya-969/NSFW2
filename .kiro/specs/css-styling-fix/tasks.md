# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze the app.py file to identify the duplicated CSS code


  - Examine the file structure to locate where CSS is properly contained and where it's causing errors
  - Identify the exact boundaries of the problematic code
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 2. Fix the syntax error by removing duplicated CSS code
  - [x] 2.1 Remove the CSS code that's outside of string literals













    - Delete the duplicated CSS code that's causing the syntax error
    - Ensure all CSS is properly contained within string literals or appropriate functions



    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_
  
  - [ ] 2.2 Verify that all necessary CSS styling is preserved
    - Compare the original and modified CSS to ensure no styling rules are lost
    - Make any necessary adjustments to maintain the original styling
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Test the fixed code
  - [ ] 3.1 Verify syntax correctness
    - Check that the Python file can be parsed without syntax errors
    - Run a basic syntax check on the modified file
    - _Requirements: 1.1_
  
  - [ ] 3.2 Test the application functionality
    - Run the application to verify that it starts without errors
    - Check that all UI components are displayed with the correct styling
    - Test interactions to ensure functionality is preserved
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement best practices for future maintenance
  - Add clear comments to mark the beginning and end of embedded CSS
  - Consider recommendations for better CSS organization in the future
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
