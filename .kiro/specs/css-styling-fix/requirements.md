# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical syntax error in the app.py file that prevents the application from running. The error is related to CSS styling code that appears to be duplicated and improperly placed in the Python file, causing a SyntaxError with an "invalid decimal literal" message on line 1235.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the syntax error in app.py so that the application can run without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app.py file is executed THEN it should not produce any syntax errors
2. WHEN examining the code THEN all CSS styling should be properly contained within string literals or appropriate functions
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the styling should be applied correctly to the UI elements
4. WHEN making changes to fix the syntax error THEN the original styling and functionality should be preserved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the CSS styling is properly organized to prevent similar errors in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN CSS styling should be clearly separated from Python code
2. WHEN CSS styling needs to be modified in the future THEN it should be easy to locate and edit without risking syntax errors
3. WHEN the application is maintained THEN the styling code should follow best practices for embedding CSS in Python applications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain its visual appearance and functionality after the fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is run after the fix THEN all UI elements should appear with the intended styling
2. WHEN interacting with the application THEN all functionality should work as expected
3. WHEN viewing the application on different devices THEN the responsive design should work correctly
