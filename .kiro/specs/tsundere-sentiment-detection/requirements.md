# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing context-based sentiment analysis system to specifically detect and handle tsundere-style responses and farewell phrases in the Mari AI Chat application. The goal is to distinguish between genuine negative sentiment and character-based tsundere responses (where apparent hostility masks affection), preventing the system from getting stuck in negative sentiment loops when users interact with Mari's tsundere personality traits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to distinguish between Mari's tsundere-style responses and genuine negative sentiment, so that the affection system doesn't get stuck in negative loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mari uses tsundere-style phrases like "じゃあな！" (See you later!) THEN the system SHALL recognize them as character expressions rather than genuine hostility
2. WHEN the user responds to tsundere expressions with neutral or positive sentiment THEN the system SHALL avoid negative affection penalties
3. WHEN the system detects a potential tsundere expression THEN it SHALL apply appropriate sentiment classification that considers the character's personality
4. WHEN the system detects farewell phrases in Japanese or English THEN it SHALL properly categorize them based on cultural context rather than literal translation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to consider Mari's character profile when analyzing sentiment, so that her tsundere personality traits don't cause affection level degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing sentiment THEN the system SHALL incorporate Mari's character profile as context
2. WHEN Mari uses rough language that is part of her character profile THEN the system SHALL avoid excessive negative affection impact
3. WHEN Mari's responses include character-consistent phrases that might appear negative THEN the system SHALL distinguish them from genuine hostility
4. WHEN the system detects phrases that match Mari's established speech patterns THEN it SHALL apply character-appropriate sentiment analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to break out of negative sentiment loops automatically, so that conversations can recover naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects a potential negative sentiment loop THEN it SHALL implement recovery mechanisms
2. WHEN the same negative phrase is repeated multiple times THEN the system SHALL reduce its affection impact over time
3. WHEN the user attempts to change the subject after negative interactions THEN the system SHALL facilitate sentiment recovery
4. WHEN the system detects a prolonged negative sentiment pattern THEN it SHALL gradually normalize the affection impact

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide the LLM with appropriate context about Mari's tsundere nature, so that responses can be generated with awareness of the character's emotional complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating prompts for the LLM THEN the system SHALL include information about Mari's tsundere personality traits
2. WHEN the system detects potential tsundere expressions THEN it SHALL provide this context to the LLM for response generation
3. WHEN the LLM is generating responses THEN it SHALL have access to information about whether phrases are genuine hostility or character-based expressions
4. WHEN the system provides context to the LLM THEN it SHALL include guidance on distinguishing between tsundere expressions and genuine negative sentiment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tsundere sentiment detection system to integrate seamlessly with the existing context-based sentiment analysis, so that implementation is efficient and maintains all current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the tsundere detection THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing sentiment analysis pipeline
2. WHEN deploying the enhanced system THEN existing user sessions and affection levels SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the system encounters errors in tsundere detection THEN it SHALL gracefully fall back to the standard context-based sentiment analysis
4. WHEN analyzing sentiment THEN the system SHALL prioritize performance to maintain responsive user experience
